## Description

<br>

A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. **Team Profile Generator** uses `Jest` for running unit tests and `Inquirer` for collecting user input. It also features validation to ensure that user input provided is in the proper expected format. **Team Profile Generator** used both `Object Oriented Programming` and `Test Driven Development` in its development.

<br>

<br>

Clone the repository to your local machine, open your terminal, and navigate to the root folder in the **Team Profile Generator** repository. To install the necessary dependencies, run `npm i` in your command-line terminal.

<br>
